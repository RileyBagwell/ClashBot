# ClashBot

## About
ClashBot is a discord bot intended assist in the process of researching your opponents during Clash tournaments in League of Legends. Other sites exist with a similar purpose, but ClashBot is made with tournaments in mind, where you need to pull up information for 5 different players in a small amount of time between matches. Links to u.gg sites are also provided, with a larger and more detailed database.  
This repository is mostly to upload builds of the project to work on between multiple computers. ClashBot is mostly a project to:  
1) Practice Python
2) Mess with the Riot API
3) Learn and play with MySQL
